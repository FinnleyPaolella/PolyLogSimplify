# PolyLogSimplify
A Mathematica package which can be used to simplify expressions of di- and trilogarithms evaluated at algebraic numbers. Its main purpose is to prove a new integral representation:
$$
\displaystyle\int_{(x_1,\dots,x_5)\in\mathbb{R}^5: x_1^2+\cdots+x_5^2\} \frac{1}{(1-x_1)\cdots(1-x_5)} = \frac{7}{6}\pi^2\zeta(3)
$$
## Usage
The PolyLogSimplify.wl file can be loaded via Get. For example usage, see the file that computes I_5. For convenient editing of the package, the notebook version PolyLogSimlify.nb can be used.
