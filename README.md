# PolyLogSimplify
A Mathematica package which can be used to simplify expressions of di- and trilogarithms evaluated at algebraic numbers. Its main purpose is to prove a new integral representation of zeta(3).
## Usage
The PolyLogSimplify.wl file can be loaded via Get. For example usage, see the file that computes I_5. For convenient editing of the package, the notebook version PolyLogSimlify.nb can be used.
